          You'll often find me speaking at colleges, or technology  
          events showing people how easy it is to create robust web 
          applications. I cater to a wide variety of audiences, from curious the
          first-timers looking to get their feet wet in web development to the
          experienced professionals looking to perfect their craft with new tips and tricks.

          A huge amount of effort goes into all my talks and workshops, and I continue to refine my approach over time. 
          The events that I find the most fulfilling and receive the best feedback are those that blend 
          learning with entertainment. I usually blend visual presentations with live demos and frequently 
          involve the audience in activities. My talks are very carefully prepared and rehearsed yet also 
          remain as ad-libbed as possible; they must feel organic and natural as possible.
